<h1 center>My Awesome Project</h1>
<b>Description:</b> A throwback to your childhood! This full stack application is used to take care of your baby Tomagachis like back in the day. You are able to feed, bathe and nurture them just like you would be able to on the handheld device. Once you get all stats to 100, your Tomagachi is fully taken care of!

<b>Tech Used:</b>JavaScript, Node.js. Express.js, EJS, MongoDB, Passport.js, CSS

<b>Lessons Learned</b>:Backend languages are powerful! Being able to utitlize Node.js and MongoDB in this project were very helpful. I still want to play around with the PUT functionality of this project a bit more and maybe go back and edit this project entirely. It was nice to build a project off of something that I was fond of as a child. Made this project very nostalgic.
